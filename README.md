# Airplane Fare Price Prediction using Machine Learning
It is a machine learning project designed to predict the price of a commercial airplane based on various features such as model type, manufacturing year, engine type, seating capacity, and other factors that affect the value of the aircraft. This project can be useful for aircraft manufacturers, airlines, and other aviation-related industries to help them make informed decisions when it comes to pricing their products.

The project involves the use of supervised learning algorithms, specifically regression models, to analyze historical data on airplane prices and identify patterns and correlations between the various features and the final sale price. The data used for the project is typically obtained from various sources such as aircraft manufacturers, airlines, and industry databases.

The first step in the project is data preprocessing, which involves cleaning and transforming the data to prepare it for analysis. This may include removing irrelevant or duplicate data, filling in missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

Next, the data is split into training and testing sets, with the former used to train the machine learning model and the latter used to evaluate its performance. Various regression algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forests can be used for the modeling phase.

After training the model, it is evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE) to measure the accuracy of its predictions. Once the model has been trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict the price of new airplanes based on their features.

Overall, the airplane price prediction project is a useful tool for aircraft manufacturers and airlines to help them make informed pricing decisions based on market trends and other factors that affect the value of commercial airplanes.
